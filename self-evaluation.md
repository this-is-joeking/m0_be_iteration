# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
>I feel quite confident with the each method. (10/10) Its function makes perfect sense.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
> I felt this and the conditionals were similarly advanced concepts. I did not really have any unproductive struggle. I didn't really have much struggle, I suppose it fit in nicely with prior classes taken.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
> I could use more practice combining the `each` method with `if` statements. I will come up with some challenge for myself to do this, and will add time on my calendar to do this later today.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
> No questions at this time. This one really clicked with me quickly.
